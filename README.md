## Why Am I Doing This? ü§∑üèæ‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è
During the course of taking a deeper dive into HTML, primarily through taking courses by [Jen Kramer](https://www.linkedin.com/in/jen4web/) on [LinkedIn Learning](https://bit.ly/3VkpvwB) I realised that a lot of the HTML I had been writing before was simply just <strong>a coat hanger for my CSS</strong>. It was there simply to provide the content for my CSS to be able to style. I didn't really give much thought to things like <strong>accessibility, structure, semantics</strong>, choosing to care more about just having a live version of my build that <em>looked</em> right. 

So, I've decided to stop trying to speedrun through complex projects that will only further establish that shakey foundation, and instead take on smaller projects that would allow me to be more <em>intentional</em> with my code.

## What I Would've Done Differently Looking Back on this Project
- rel="shortcut icon" is no longer appropriate. Now all you should write is rel="icon" to provide the image that will act as the icon for this wesbtite anywhere it is displayed as well as its favicon. More on that [here](https://devdocs.io/html/link_types#icon). If you need more proof look at [w3c](https://www.w3schools.com/html/html_favicon.asp), and how they've structured their icon link.
